 * Description :
 *   Your opponent takes damage equivalent to your soul output + soul trigger upon trigger
 *   step (if any) onto their clock. 7 cards on the clock raises your level by 1, and any
 *   additional damage are retained onto your next level. However, should you flip over a
 *   climax card, all the damage sustained for that damage step is canceled, and they are
 *   moved into the waiting room (discard pile) instead.
